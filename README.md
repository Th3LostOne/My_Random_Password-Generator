**Password Generator**

A simple Python-based password generator that combines user-provided words with random symbols to create secure passwords.  

## Features
- Accepts input words from the command line or user prompt.
- Appends random special characters for enhanced security.
- Shuffles the characters to generate a strong and unpredictable password.

## How It Works
1. Users provide a set of words via command line arguments or manual input.
2. The program combines these words, appends random special characters, and shuffles everything to create a secure password.
3. The generated password is displayed to the user.
